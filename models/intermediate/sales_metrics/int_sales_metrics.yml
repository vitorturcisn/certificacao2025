  - name: int_sales_metrics
    description: This model enriches the sales order details by joining data from `sales_order_header` and `order_details`. It provides key metrics such as the gross and net total order values, lead time, order delay status, and discount application, while also transforming the `ONLINE_ORDER` column into a new column `ORDER_TYPE` to identify whether the order was made online or by a salesperson.
