    description: |
      This model enriches the `store` data by adding business address information. It combines the `store` table, which contains store details like store name, with the `business_address` table, which provides the address IDs associated with each store. A LEFT JOIN is used to link the two tables based on `BUSINESS_ENTITY_ID`, ensuring that all stores are included, even if they do not have a corresponding business address.
    columns:
      - name: BUSINESS_ENTITY_ID
        description: Unique identifier for the business entity. This is the primary key used to link the `store` and `business_address` tables.

        tests:
          - not_null

      - name: ADDRESS_ID
        description: The identifier for the business address associated with the store. This is retrieved from the `business_address` table. If no address is linked, this column will be null.
