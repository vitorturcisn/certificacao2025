      This model enriches the `person` data by adding business address information. It combines the `person` table, which contains basic details like full name and email promotion preferences, with the `business_address` table, which provides the address IDs related to each person. A LEFT JOIN is used to link the two tables based on `BUSINESS_ENTITY_ID`, ensuring that all persons are included, even if they do not have a corresponding address.
    columns:
      - name: BUSINESS_ENTITY_ID
        description: Unique identifier for the business entity. This is the primary key used to link the `person` and `business_address` tables.
