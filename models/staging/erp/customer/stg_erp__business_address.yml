    description: |
      This model renames and casts two key columns (`BUSINESSENTITYID` and `ADDRESSID`) from the `BUSINESSENTITYADDRESS` table, making them easier to work with in subsequent analyses. It converts these columns into `business_entity_id` and `address_id` with integer data types to ensure consistency in the data.
    columns:
      - name: business_entity_id
        description: Identifier for a business entity.
        tests:
          - not_null

      - name: address_id
        description: Unique identifier for an address associated with the business entity.
        tests:
          - not_null
