  - name: int_prep_customer
    description: |
      This model enriches the `customer` data by adding store and person information. It combines the `customer` table, which contains customer details like customer ID, with the `store` table, which provides the store name and address, and the `person` table, which includes customer-related personal details like full name and email promotion preference. A LEFT JOIN is used to link the three tables based on their respective keys (`STORE_ID`, `PERSON_ID`), ensuring that all customers are included, even if they do not have corresponding store or person data. The model also uses `ROW_NUMBER()` to handle duplicate full names, appending a "2" to the name if it appears more than once.

    columns:
      - name: CUSTOMER_ID
        description: Unique identifier for the customer. This is the primary key used to link the customer with the store and person data.
